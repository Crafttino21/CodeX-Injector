**DISCLAIMER: This is for education Purpose ONLY! I dont take any response for Game Bans or Harm!**


# Version 1.1 + 1.2
**Features**
* [X] Put a DLL Detection in the code so you dont net to enter the path of the file
* [X] Reworked the code
* [X] Updated file signature (against AC)
* [X] Make a protected version of the injector
* [X] Manual Mapping (Testing so ONLY in Pre-release!)

**Planed**
* [ ] Bypass for BE and EAC (MAYBE!)
* [ ] String Cleaner (to remove traces)

**Should i use the Normal or Protected version?**
What you should use is based on the game or process you wanna use:
**CodeX DLL Injector** = For games with none or Bad anticheat (e.x Bodycam, Indie Games, more). This version runs Native so it more efficient for your system (Faster but better to detect by Anticheats) 

**CodeX DLL Injector_protected** = For games with a More advanced anticheats or where you not sure what kind of AC it used (e.x CS2 [VAC]). It runs in a VM so a anticheat cant read into the process and strings are protected for scans. But based on the VM it takes more Performance of your CPU and CANT run into a Virtual Maschine like Virtual box. If you dont trust me or cheat into a VM use the Non-Protected version! (Slower but more Secure)

**Advise**: The Protection ISNT a 100% Secureness or shit like "1000% UUNDETECTEBLE!?!?!?!!?", Advanced ANticheats like EasyAntiCheat (EAC) and BattleEye (BE) will easy detect and Ban you based on the Nature of LoadLibayW Injection methods! Dont be stupid and cry in the commes that your Fortnite account got banned because you used the injector and be to stupid to read this advice!




# Status: Undetected (Not Contain EAC and BE)
